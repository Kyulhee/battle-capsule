# Next Chat Handoff

> Last updated: 2026-06-01. Short context only; read `CLAUDE.md`, `DOCS_INDEX.md`, `MASTERPLAN.md`, and `IMPACT_MAP.md` before code changes.

## Current State

- Branch: `master`.
- Latest completed slice: `v2.0.6 — conservative 40-bot scale preset smoke`.
- Next structural slice: `v2.0.7 — MapDefinition position query compatibility`.
- Release remains paused. Continue version-to-version development unless the user explicitly asks for a release.
- Expected Godot startup warning remains: `AssetCatalog: 7 configured asset paths are missing; fallbacks remain active.`
- `asset_generator/` is an external source pool and must stay untracked unless selected files are promoted into runtime assets.
- `docs/ASSET_GENERATION_PROMPTS.md` is local prompt scratch and should stay untracked unless the user asks to publish it.
- `docs/ASSET_STATUS.md` is now the concise asset-state handoff document.

## Recent Completed Commits

- `a7c23bf feat: promote remaining artifact icons` — Escape Capsule and Ghost Grass PNGs were normalized, cataloged, and verified as real artifact icon paths.
- `d445692 docs: sync asset and v2 handoff` — compacted handoff/devlog docs and added `ASSET_STATUS.md`.
- `14a1a33 feat: add map definition compatibility layer` — added `MapDefinition.gd` and validation tooling.
- `2e69bb7 feat: merge map definition scale presets` — added baseline/medium scale preset data and runtime merge support.
- `ada6ad4 feat: add read-only full map overlay` — added the read-only Full Map overlay and smoke verification.
- `7790567 test: expand map definition validation` — expanded MapDefinition validation for POI, obstacle, spawn/loot, and zone sanity checks.
- `8a24fbf refactor: extract settings manager` — moved settings persistence/audio/display mutation into `SettingsManager.gd`.
- Current v2.0.6 slice adds and smokes the conservative `large_40` scale preset.

Earlier v1.12 work added Emergency Shell/Escape Capsule, Ghost Grass, player artifact runtime state, artifact visuals, compact artifact selection UI, raw PNG icon loading, bush GLB visuals, restored bush interaction semantics, and bush visual feedback. Full recent detail is in `DEVLOG.md` and `devlog/v1.12.md`.

## Recommended Next Slice

`v2.0.7 — MapDefinition position query compatibility`

- Keep `Main.gd` as match-global orchestrator.
- Add bounded position/query helpers to `MapDefinition` only where map/full-map consumers currently duplicate spec math.
- Preserve existing `MapSpec` compatibility and validation behavior.
- Cover the compatibility helper with `verify_map_definition.gd`.
- Do not start 60/99-player tuning until the query path and current 40-bot preset stay stable.

## Asset Notes

- All six starting artifact icons are integrated.
- Bush GLBs are integrated and visual-only; `Bush.tscn` Area3D remains gameplay authority.
- Generated tree/rock/log/landmark GLBs remain deferred. Promote them only as selected runtime assets and preserve explicit collision/cover authority.
- Deferred asset decisions are tracked in `ASSET_STATUS.md`.

## Tooling Note

The Windows shell sandbox may fail with `CreateProcessAsUserW failed: 1312`. If so, retry simple commands with `sandbox_permissions: "require_escalated"`.

## User Preferences

- Use Korean.
- Work in small verified slices: plan -> edit -> verify -> commit/push.
- Keep active docs compact; archive raw/full history.
- Prefer data/tuning/catalog boundaries over broad gameplay rewrites.
